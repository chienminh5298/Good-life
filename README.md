# Community Volunteering Platform
A platform to improve community connectedness and mutual aid. This application would reduce social inequality by promoting community engagement and participation in need-based reciprocal support. Volunteers and organizations will be able to post and discover volunteering opportunities based on skills and interests, as well as create profiles, view role-specific dashboards, search and filter options for volunteering opportunities, and interact with posts.

## Project Overview
The Community Volunteering Platform will serve as a bridge between volunteers and organizations, enhancing community engagement and promoting social support. The platformâ€™s goal is to empower users (volunteers and organizations) to post and discover opportunities, interact based on shared interests, and contribute to reducing social inequality.

## Core Features
### User Registration & Profile Management
-Users (volunteers and organizations) can create accounts.
-Organizations can post opportunities, while volunteers can showcase their skills, availability, and areas of interest.
-Role-specific profiles will be created for volunteers and organizations.

### Opportunity Posting & Discovery
-Organizations can create posts for volunteering opportunities, tagging required skills and interests.
-Volunteers can browse, search, and filter opportunities based on location, skills, interests, or time commitment.

### Interactive Posts
-Users can interact with posts through comments or direct messaging to ask questions or express interest.

## Architecture
### Frontend:
-React.js: The frontend will use React to create a dynamic and responsive interface.

### Backend:
-Node.js and Express.js: The backend will handle API requests and interact with the database.
-RESTful APIs: Implement APIs for user authentication, profile management, post creation, and opportunity discovery.

## Technology Stack
-Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with TypeScript for better type safety)
-Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API
-Hosting: AWS EC2 for hosting the platform and storing assets
